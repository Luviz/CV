Around your computer I'm the one u need!
I would say that I have around 20 years experinec with coumputer, but most of my expcirens start when I was 10 building my 1st computer and started understating how the hardware works. when I was 12 I started experimating with abit with softwere but I didn't enjoyed it at the moment in sted I started working with graphic design and 3D design.
Untill my second year of hightschool I had my fist course programing in Java and quickly understud it and saw the mistake I was doing when I was 12. I quickly went thought the at 3 times the speed of the coures. 
but that was only child's play, now that I look back 2012 I started a software engineering education at BTH. There I leard C++ and Object Oriented programing.
